# Day -11[String]

## String and StringBuilder

String is a collection of characters.

We have String Data type in java.

The value assigning to String type variable will be in double quotes i.e., “ ”.

String syntax is as shown below

```java
// String variable_name ="String_value";
String a="Dileep";
String b="Dileep";
System.out.println(a==b); // true
```

We have separate memory for string in heap memory called String pool.

Two reference variable stores same object, then Both reference variable refers to only one object.

### Strings are immutable

Strings are immutable i.e., we cannot modify String value, but we can reassign a reference variable with new object.

### How to create objects with same value?

By using “new” Keyword, which create object outside of string pool but inside the heap memory.

This additional feature of “+” operator is achieved by operator overloading.

```java
String name1="Dileep";
String a=new String("Dileep");
String b=new String("Dileep");
System.out.println(name1==a); // false same reason as below camporison
System.out.println(a==b);. // false because reference variables are not pointing to same object, compares the objects
System.out.println(a.equals(b));. // true, Compares the values
```

### Use of “+” operator with Strings

We can use “+” operator to concatenate two strings. This is called String Concatenation.

In java there is no other operators like “*” (Asterik) is overloaded. It is overloaded in python and c++.

# StringBuilder

StringBuilder allows you to modify String value with the help of many pre-defined methods.

```java
StringBuilder string1= new StringBuilder();

```
